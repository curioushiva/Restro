# 🍴 RESTRO

This repository contains the code for **RESTRO**, a complete food delivery web application built with **React, Parcel, Redux Toolkit, and custom CSS**. Designed with modular architecture and modern development practices, it provides a smooth end-to-end experience — from location-based restaurant discovery to placing and tracking food orders.

## ✨ Features

- **IP-based Location Detection** — Fetches user’s approximate latitude and longitude via IPinfo API to show nearby restaurants on startup
- **Place Search Integration** — Lets users search for specific locations, fetches precise lat/lng, and updates results dynamically
- **Restaurant Discovery** — Displays restaurants by city/area with clean UI and responsive design
- **Dynamic Menus** — Click any restaurant to explore categorized menus with support for multiple items and quantities
- **Cart Management** — Add/remove items, view detailed order summary with delivery charges and totals
- **User Accounts** — Sign up, log in, and manage profile details with persistent address setup (auto-fills secondary address from location)
- **Checkout & Orders** — Place orders, view delivery time/status, and download detailed bills
- **Order History** — Retains past orders, addresses, and account details (until page refresh)
- **About Page** — Showcases developer info pulled directly from GitHub, including RESTRO’s repo data
- **Shimmer UI** — Clean skeleton loaders for seamless data fetching and better UX

## 🧩 Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```js
   git clone https://github.com/curioushiva/Restro.git
   cd restro
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```js
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure IPinfo API key**

   **Preferred (with API key) :**

- Go to : `Restro > src > hooks > reshook > line 35`
- Replace the fetch request with your own API key:
  ```js
  const data = await fetch(`${IpinfoFetch}${IpinfoAPIKey}`);
  ```
- This enables tracking of how many times location data is fetched, giving insights into app usage.

  **Alternative (without API key) :**

- If you don’t want to set an API key, simply remove `${IpinfoAPIKey}` from the same line:
  ```js
  const data = await fetch(`${IpinfoFetch}`);
  ```
- The app will still function, but you won’t be able to track usage statistics.

4. **Start the development server**

   ```js
   npm run start
   ```

5. **Build for production**  

   ```js
   npm run build
   ```
